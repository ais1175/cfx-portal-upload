In the past, using CFX Keymaster made it impossible to build CI/CD pipelines for
Escrow Resources due to the Cloudflare Bot Challenge.

However, CFX has now created a new platform called **"Portal"**, which is still
secured via Cloudflare but operates in a less restrictive attack mode, enabling
its use within a GitHub Action.

## How to Use It

To use this action, you need to authenticate via the forum using a cookie until
CFX provides API keys for this action.

1. Go to the **CFX Forum** and inspect the site using your browser's developer
   tools.
1. Navigate to the **Cookies** section and search for `_t`.
1. Copy the value of this cookie and save it in GitHub Secrets as
   `FORUM_COOKIE`.
1. Use the action in your workflow:

   ```yaml
   - name: Upload Escrow Resource
     uses: Tynopia/cfx-portal-upload
     with:
       cookie: ${{ secrets.FORUM_COOKIE }}
       zipPath: /path/to/your/zip
       assetId: 489345
   ```

1. Additionally, you can configure the `chunkSize` option.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When you log out of the forum, the cookie will become invalid, causing the
> action to fail. After configuring the secret, you should clear the cookie from
> your browser and log in again to avoid potential issues.
